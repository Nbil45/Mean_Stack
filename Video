Hello,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you about the challenges I encountered while configuring the project for the Mean-Stack course. 
Despite my dedication, I have been unable to successfully set up the project, and I wanted to provide you with a detailed explanation of the issue I faced.

The problem revolves around establishing a connection with the database. There are two sections of code that attempt to establish this connection, and I 
encountered difficulties with both approaches. Let me explain further:

Connect To Database (NEW):
"
// Connect To Database (NEW) But not working!!!!!!!!!! (because of secret in db.js!!!!!)
//const db = require('./config/database');
// Map global promise - get rid of warning
//mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;
// Connect to mongoose
//mongoose.connect(db.mongoURI, {
    //useMongoClient: true
//})
//.then(() => console.log('MongoDB Connected...'))
//.catch(err => console.log(err));
"

In this code snippet, I intended to connect to the database using the configuration stored in the db.js file. However, there seems to be an issue with the 
secret in the db.js file, which prevents the connection from being established. Despite my attempts to resolve this issue through various approaches, I have 
not been able to make it work.

Connect To Database (OLD CODE):
"
mongoose.connect(config.database, { useMongoClient: true});
// On Connection
mongoose.connection.on('connected', () => {
  console.log('Connected to Database '+config.database);
});
// On Error
mongoose.connection.on('error', (err) => {
  console.log('Database error '+err);
});
"
As an alternative, I tried using the code provided above, which aims to connect to the database using the configuration stored in the config/database.js file. 
However, despite double-checking the configuration details and ensuring their accuracy, I still encountered an error preventing the successful connection to 
the database.

I have taken several steps to troubleshoot the problem, including conducting extensive research online, seeking assistance from relevant forums, and attempting
various solutions. However, despite my persistent efforts, I have been unable to resolve the issue and configure the project to run smoothly.


I wanted to bring this matter to your attention to seek your advice and potential solutions to overcome this challenge. I genuinely appreciate the 
opportunity to learn and grow in this course and remain committed to completing the project. If running the project as intended proves to be unfeasible, I
am open to exploring alternative approaches that would allow me to demonstrate my understanding of the covered concepts.

I would like to get the credits for this course as I have tried my best to solve the problems that I have been facing during my work on this course.Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Sincerely,
Nabil Sleem.
